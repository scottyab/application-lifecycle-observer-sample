# application-lifecycle-observer-sample

This is a sample project created as part of this [Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73892747/lifecycleobserver-oncreate-is-not-called-when-application-is-created) I raised 
in an attempt to isloate the issue I encounted with the `LifecycleObserver.onCreate(owner: LifecycleOwner)` not being called when obsering the Application lifecycle in particalar when the applicaion is created. 

It consists of 3 classes with log statements  

* `ApplicationLifecycleObserver` - my Observer that logs onCreate, onStart and onStop
* `MyApplication` - registers the `ApplicationLifecycleObserver` to the `ProcessLifecycleOwner` and logs when onCreate called
* `MainActivity` - empty activity which logs when onCreate called

However, as shown in the screen shot below this is behaved as expected. Therefore the issue I'm seeing in a production app could be related to something else :thinking:
